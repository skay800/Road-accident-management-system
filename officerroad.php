                <h2>Burns</h2>
                <p>Make sure you and the person who’s burned are safe and out of harm’s way. Move them away from the source of the burn. If it’s an electrical burn, turn off the power source before touching them.
Check to see if they’re breathing. If needed, start rescue breathing if you’ve been trained.
Remove restrictive items from their body, such as belts and jewelry in or near the burned areas. Burned areas typically swell quickly.
Cover the burned area. Use a clean cloth or bandage that’s moistened with cool, clean water.
Separate fingers and toes. If hands and feet are burned, separate the fingers and toes with dry and sterile, nonadhesive bandages.
Remove clothing from burned areas, but don’t try to remove clothing that’s stuck to the skin.
Avoid immersing the person or burned body parts in water. Hypothermia (severe loss of body heat) can occur if you immerse large, severe burns in water.
Raise the burned area. If possible, elevate the burned area above their heart.
Watch for shock. Signs and symptoms of shock include shallow breathing, pale complexion, and fainting.</p>

                <h2>Broken arm</h2>
                <p>Ask the patient to sit down. You will need to immobilize the arm and shoulder by placing the arm in a sling.
Place the arm in a comfortable position across the chest and ask the patient to support it.
Use a triangular bandage as an arm sling. Place some soft padding – such as clothing or a folded towel – between the injured arm and the bandage where it lies against the chest. Tie the sling in position to support the arm.
Tie a broad bandage over the sling and around the chest to secure the sling in place, avoiding the injured area if possible.
Take or send the patient to hospital or urgent care center in a sitting position.</p>

                <h2>Bleeding nose</h2>
                <p>Sit upright and lean forward. By remaining upright, you reduce blood pressure in the veins of your nose. This discourages further bleeding. ...
Gently blow your nose. Blow your nose to clear your nose of blood clots. Then spray both sides of your nose with a nasal decongestant containing oxymetazoline (Afrin).
Pinch your nose. Use your thumb and index finger to pinch your nostrils shut. Breathe through your mouth. Continue to pinch for 10 to 15 minutes. 
To prevent re-bleeding, don't pick or blow your nose and don't bend down for several hours. Keep your head higher than the level of your heart. 
If re-bleeding occurs, go through these steps again. Call your doctor if the bleeding continues.</p>

                <h2>Deep cut</h2>
                <p>Bleeding should be controlled through the use of a compress. This may be contraindicated though to eye injuries, head injuries, and to lacerations with embedded object on it.  The affected area can also be elevated above the heart level to stop bleeding.
Apply bandages.  Generally, bandages help to keep the wound from infections, and provide support to the area.  Remember not to apply the bandage too tightly as it can impede the circulation.
The first aid responder should care for shock.  In cases when the patient has become unconscious, CPR may be performed.
Finally, medical treatment should be sought as possible.  The affected are may be stitched or tetanus toxoid injection may be given to prevent infection.</p>

                <h2>Fainting</h2>
                <p>If you feel faint
Lie down or sit down. To reduce the chance of fainting again, don't get up too quickly.
Place your head between your knees if you sit down.
If someone else faints
Position the person on his or her back. If there are no injuries and the person is breathing, raise the person's legs above heart level — about 12 inches (30 centimeters) — if possible. Loosen belts, collars or other constrictive clothing.

To reduce the chance of fainting again, don't get the person up too quickly. If the person doesn't regain consciousness within one minute, call 911 or your local emergency number.

Check for breathing. If the person isn't breathing, begin CPR. Call 911 or your local emergency number. Continue CPR until help arrives or the person begins to breathe.</p>

                <p>Help the person sit in an upright position.
If the person is wearing tight clothing, especially around the neck, loosen it.
Help the person use their own inhaler or administer medication, if they have it.
If they don’t, administer an inhaler from a first aid kit.</p>
